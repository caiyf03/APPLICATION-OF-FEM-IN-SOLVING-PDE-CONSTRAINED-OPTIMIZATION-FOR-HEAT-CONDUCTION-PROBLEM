_A study on the topic:"APPLICATION OF FINITE ELEMENT METHODS IN SOLVING PDE-CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION FOR HEAT CONDUCTION PROBLEMS." In this article, we combine the concepts of finite element methods and convex optimization to sequentially solve three predictive problems in heat conduction, achieving promising results._

**ABSTRACT**

PDE-constrained optimization involves partial differential equations (PDEs) and optimization, playing crucial role in modeling and solving complex real-world problems. It is widely applied across
various fields, especially in optimization design, optimal control, and inverse problems like parameter estimation. This paper focuses on the Simultaneous Analysis and Design (SAND) method and its
application in specific types of PDE-constrained optimization problems (with FEM-like methods). Through three thermodynamics cases involving heat conduction in conductors, we address issues
such as temperature distribution fitting and internal heat source prediction. Our paper is mainly inspired by the Finite Element chapter in the Computational Science and Engineering course and
the Convex Optimization section in the Numerical Optimization course, and extends the content of FEM to further read the relevant literature on Finite Element Tearing and Interconnect (FETI).
It is worth mentioning that all the code designs related to this paper are original to our team, with no borrowing or referencing from existing works. The overall approach of this paper is to practically
apply algorithms to specific thermodynamic case studies after thoroughly understanding the relevant field. Although it does not present entirely new and innovative ideas, it includes our own insights
and expansion attempts. This paper aims to emphasize the important role of effective numerical techniques in real-life applications. Through this discussion, we hope to gain deeper insights into
Computational Science and Engineering, particularly in the field of Finite Element optimization problem-solving, and ultimately apply these insights effectively in our practical work and research.
